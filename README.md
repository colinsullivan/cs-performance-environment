# Colin's Music Performance Environment
I am rewriting my music performance tools to leverage SuperCollider for sequence generation, custom synths and audio effects, and using modern web technologies to build the UIs.

This environment is assumed to be paired with a DAW to handle some routing, and the DAW is assumed to leverage Ableton Link for synchronization.

## Status
I am only beginning to rewrite patches from other environments and move them here, and am in the early stages of this experimentation and development.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
